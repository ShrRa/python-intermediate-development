## Light Curve Analysis Project
For this workshop, let's assume that you  have joined a software development team that has been working on the
[light curve analysis project](https://github.com/ShrRa/InterPython_Workshop_Example)
developed in Python and stored on GitHub. The purpose of this software is to analyze the variability of astronomical sources, 
using observations that come from different instruments.

> ## What Does Light Curve Dataset Contain?
>
> For developing and testing our software project, we will use two RR Lyrae candidates variability datasets.
>
> The first dataset, `kepler_RRLyr.csv`, contains observations coming from the Kepler space telescope.
> In this dataset, all observations are related to the same source,
> i.e. the whole table represents a single light curve. The second dataset, `lsst_RRLyr.pkl`, contains synthetic
> observations of 25 presumably variable sources from the LSST Data Preview 0. Considering that the datasets
> come from different instruments, they also have different formats and column names - a common
> situation in real life. It is always a good idea to develop your
> software in such a way that it remains usable even if the format of the input data has changed. We will use the differences
> of the datasets to illustrate some of the topics during this workshop.

The project is not finished and contains some errors.
You will be working on your own and in collaboration with others
to fix and build on top of the existing code during the course.

## Downloading Our Software Project

To start working on the project, you will first
create a copy of the software project template repository
from GitHub within your own GitHub account
and then obtain a local copy of that project (from your GitHub) on your machine.

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account
   and that you have set up your SSH key pair for authentication with GitHub,
   as explained in [Setup](../setup.html#secure-access-to-github-using-git-from-command-line).
2. Log into your GitHub account.
3. Go to the [software project repository](https://github.com/ShrRa/InterPython_Workshop_Example)
   in GitHub.

   ![Software project template repository in GitHub](../fig/11_soft_proj_2_repo.svg){: .image-with-shadow width="800px" }

4. Click the `Fork` button towards the top right of the repository’s GitHub page to
   create a fork of the repository under your GitHub account.
   Remember, you will need to be signed into GitHub for the `Fork` button to work.

   _Note: each participant is creating their own fork of the project to work on._
5. Make sure to select your personal account
   and set the name of the project to `InterPython_Workshop_Example`
   (you can call it anything you like,
   but it may be easier for future group exercises if everyone uses the same name).
   Also set the new repository's visibility to 'Public' -
   so it can be seen by others and by third-party Continuous Integration (CI) services
   (to be covered later on in the course) and select the `Copy the main branch only` checkbox.

   ![Making a copy of the software project template repository in GitHub](../fig/11_soft_proj_3_repo.svg){: .image-with-shadow width="600px" }

6. Click the `Create fork` button
   and wait for GitHub to import the copy of the repository under your account.
7. Locate the forked repository under your own GitHub account. GitHub should redirect you there
   automatically after creating the fork. If this does not happen, click your user icon in the top
   right corner and select Your Repositories from the drop-down menu, then locate your newly created fork.

> ## Exercise: Obtain the Software Project Locally
> Using the command line, clone the copied repository
> from your GitHub account into the home directory on your computer using SSH.
> Which command(s) would you use to get a detailed list of contents of the directory you have just cloned?
> > ## Solution
> > 1. Find the SSH URL of the software project repository to clone from your GitHub account.
> > Make sure you do not clone the original template repository but rather your own copy,
> > as you should be able to push commits to it later on.
> > Also make sure you select the **SSH tab** and not the **HTTPS** one -
> > you'll be able to clone with HTTPS, but not to send your changes back to GitHub!
> >
> > ![URL to clone the repository in GitHub](../fig/11_5_soft_proj_repo.png){: .image-with-shadow width="800px" }

> >     ~~~
> >     {: .language-bash}
> >    Make sure you are cloning your copy of the software project and not the template repository.

### Our Software Project Structure
Let’s inspect the content of the software project from the command line.
From the root directory of the project,
you can use the command `ls -l` to get a more detailed list of the contents.
You should see something similar to the following.

~~~
$ cd ~/InterPython_Workshop_Example
$ ls -l
total 284
drwxrwxr-x 2 alex alex     52 Jan 10 20:29 data
-rw-rw-r-- 1 alex alex 285218 Jan 10 20:29 light-curve-analysis.ipynb

drwxrwxr-x 2 alex alex     51 Jan 10 20:29 tests
...
~~~
{: .language-bash}

As can be seen from the above, our software project contains the README file 
(that typically describes the project, its usage, installation, authors and how to contribute), 
Jupyter Notebook `light-curve-analysis.ipynb`, and three directories - `lcanalyzer`, `data` and `tests`.

The Jupyter Notebook `light-curve-analysis.ipynb` is where exploratory analysis is done, 
and on closer inspection, we can see that the `lcanalyzer` directory contains two Python 
scripts - `views.py` and `models.py`. We will have a more detailed look into these shortly.

~~~
$ cd ~/InterPython_Workshop_Example/lcanalyzer
$ ls -l

{: .language-bash}

Directory `data` contains two files with the lightcurves coming from two instruments, Kepler and LSST:
~~~
$ cd ~/InterPython_Workshop_Example/data
$ ls -l

Directory `tests` contains several tests that have been implemented already.
We will be adding more tests during the course as our code grows.

An important thing to note here is that the structure of the project is not arbitrary.
One of the big differences between novice and intermediate software development is
planning the structure of your code.
This structure includes software components and behavioural interactions between them
(including how these components are laid out in a directory and file structure).
A novice will often make up the structure of their code as they go along.
However, for more advanced software development,
we need to plan this structure - called a *software architecture* - beforehand.

Let's have a more detailed look into what a software architecture is
and which architecture is used by our software project
before we start adding more code to it.

## Software Architecture
A software architecture is the fundamental structure of a software system
that is decided at the beginning of project development
based on its requirements and cannot be changed that easily once implemented.
It refers to a "bigger picture" of a software system
that describes high-level components (modules) of the system
and how they interact.

In software design and development,
large systems or programs are often decomposed into a set of smaller modules
each with a subset of functionality.
Typical examples of modules in programming are software libraries;
some software libraries, such as `numpy` and `matplotlib` in Python,
are bigger modules that contain several smaller sub-modules.
Another example of modules are classes in object-oriented programming languages.

> ## Programming Modules and Interfaces
> Although modules are self-contained and independent elements to a large extent
> (they can depend on other modules),
> there are well-defined ways of how they interact with one another.
> These rules of interaction are called **programming interfaces** -
> they define how other modules (clients) can use a particular module.
> Typically, an interface to a module includes
> rules on how a module can take input from
> and how it gives output back to its clients.
> A client can be a human, in which case we also call these user interfaces.
> Even smaller functional units such as functions/methods have clearly defined interfaces -
> a function/method’s definition
> (also known as a *signature*)
> states what parameters it can take as input and what it returns as an output.

{: .callout}

There are various software architectures around defining different ways of
dividing the code into smaller modules with well defined roles, for example:

- [Model–View–Controller (MVC) architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller),
  which we will look into in detail and use for our software project,
- [Service-oriented architecture (SOA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture),
  which separates code into distinct services,
  accessible over a network by consumers (users or other services)
  that communicate with each other by passing data in a well-defined, shared format (protocol),
- [Client-server architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model),
  where clients request content or service from a server,
  initiating communication sessions with servers,
  which await incoming requests (e.g. email, network printing, the Internet),
- [Multilayer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture),
  is a type of architecture in which presentation,
  application processing
  and data management functions
  are split into distinct layers and may even be physically separated to run on separate machines -
  some more detail on this later in the course.

### Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture
MVC architecture divides the related program logic
into three interconnected modules:

- **Model** (data)
- **View** (client interface),  and
- **Controller** (processes that handle input/output and manipulate the data).

**Model** represents the data used by a program and also contains operations/rules
for manipulating and changing the data in the model.
This may be a database, a file, a single data object or a series of objects -
for example a table representing light curve observations.

**View** is the means of displaying data to users/clients within an application
(i.e. provides visualisation of the state of the model).
For example, displaying a window with input fields and buttons (Graphical User Interface, GUI)
or textual options within a command line (Command Line Interface, CLI) are examples of Views.
They include anything that the user can see from the application.
While building GUIs is not the topic of this course,
we will cover building CLIs in Python in later episodes.

**Controller** manipulates both the **Model** and the **View**.
It accepts input from the **View**
and performs the corresponding action on the **Model** (changing the state of the model)
and then updates the **View** accordingly.
For example, on user request,
**Controller** updates a picture on a user's GitHub profile
and then modifies the **View** by displaying the updated profile back to the user.

#### MVC Examples

MVC architecture can be applied in scientific applications in the following manner.
Model comprises those parts of the application that deal with
some type of scientific processing or manipulation of the data,
e.g. numerical algorithm, simulation, statistical analysis.
View is a visualisation, or format, of the output,
e.g. graphical plot, diagram, chart, data table, file.
Controller is the part that ties the scientific processing and output parts together,
mediating input and passing it to the model or view,
e.g. command line options, mouse clicks, input files.
For example, the diagram below depicts the use of MVC architecture for the
[DNA Guide Graphical User Interface application](https://www.software.ac.uk/developing-scientific-applications-using-model-view-controller-approach).

> > MVC architecture is a popular choice when designing web and mobile applications.
> > Users interact with a web/mobile application by sending various requests to it.
> > Forms to collect users inputs/requests

> > The Controller retrieves the account information for the user from the Model
> > and passes it to the View for rendering.

> > by asking it to update its personal information.
> > Controller verifies the correctness of the information

> > postal address and phone number are in the correct format, etc.)
> > and passes it to the Model for permanent storage.

> ## Separation of Concerns
> Separation of concerns is important when designing software architectures

#### Our Project's MVC Architecture

Our software project uses the MVC architecture.
The file `light-curve-analysis.ipynb` is the **Controller** module
that performs basic statistical analysis over light curve data
and provides the main entry point of the code.
The **View** and **Model** modules are contained in the files `views.py` and `models.py`, respectively,
and are conveniently named.
Data underlying the **Model** is contained within the directory `data` -
as we have seen already it contains several files with light curves.

We will revisit the software architecture and MVC topics once again in later episodes
when we talk in more detail about 
[software's requirements](../31-software-requirements/index.html)
and [software design](../32-software-design/index.html).
We now proceed to set up our virtual development environment
and start working with the code using a more convenient graphical tool -
[IDE Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/).
