[Poetry installation instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

We can install Poetry much like any other Python distributable package, using `pip`:

~~~
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install poetry
~~~
{: .language-bash}

To test, we can ask where Poetry is installed:

~~~
$ which poetry
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/home/alex/InterPython_Workshop_Example/venv/bin/poetry
~~~
{: .output}
