# Intermediate Python for Astronomical Software Development

An intermediate-level course in research software engineering and development skills and working as part of a 
team (using Python as an example language). This lesson teaches intermediate-level software development 
skills in a way that mimics a typical software development 
process in a team, starting from an [existing piece of software](https://github.com/ShrRa/InterPython_Workshop_Example). The lesson is based on the Carpentries Incubator "Intermediate Research Software Development" workshop but modified independently from the developers of the original course.

This course is made for astronomers who already have basic software development skills obtained either by 
self-learning or attending a foundational course such as the novice [Software Carpentry Python course][swc-lessons]. 
However, their software 
development-related projects are now becoming larger and more complex and they need more 
intermediate software engineering skills to help them design more robust software code, 
automate the process of testing and verifying its correctness and support collaborations with others.

### Lesson Status

The lesson is currently in development.

## Teaching the Lesson

The lesson is suitable for both instructor-led teaching or guided self-learning where instructors provide help 
and answer questions (synchronously or asynchrounously) as learners go through the course on their own. 
Initially, in sections 1-3 of the lesson, 
learners are working on a software project and going through exercises individually.
In sections 4 and 5, they are grouped and work in teams,
as they would when collaborating on a team software project development.

The lesson has 5 sections; 
each section can be delivered or worked through in self-learning mode over a half a day to a day, 
depending on the pace.
We would recommend setting aside one day per section to make sure the delivery is not rushed.
